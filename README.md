## Introduction
Welcome to Eat-Da-Burger!
An application that displays a full-stack application in action. The front end has been implemented with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap while the backend has been accomplished with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and ORM.

Create a burger by typing a new burger in the form and submitting it. Your burger should be displayed under the 'Available Burgers' section.

Enjoy the burger!
